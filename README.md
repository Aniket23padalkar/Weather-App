[Weather App]()

---

## 📝 Description

This is my **React-based Weather App** built using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. It allows users to search for any city and view **real-time weather information**.

I also implemented an **auto-search (autocomplete)** feature using an API that suggests city names as the user types. The app shows a **loading state** while fetching data, making the experience smoother and more dynamic.

## 🧠 What I Learned

-   How to **fetch and manage API data** efficiently using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
-   Handling **loading states** and **error messages** gracefully
-   Implementing **autocomplete search** using API suggestions
-   Using **conditional rendering** to show or hide components based on state
-   Understanding **component-based structure** and data flow in React

## 🧰 Tech Stack

-   **React.js**

## 🎯 Next Steps

Now that I’ve learned to handle APIs more confidently in React, my next goal is to build **finance-based React projects**, like a **stock watchlist app** or **crypto price tracker**, moving toward **fintech-focused applications**.
